#MyDesk Project

A website that was created as a final project at the Coders Lab's programming school. MyDesk reminds the organizer which provides useful tools that we keep on our desks. We can find there a calendar with the current date, sticky notes to save, a calculator and a dose of chumor about Chuck Norris :)

The project is created in the React framework using ES6 Standard, RWD, Sass and Webpack
